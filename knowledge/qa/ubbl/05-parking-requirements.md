# Parking Requirements

**Important**: Parking requirements are governed by **local authority guidelines** (e.g., DBKL Guidelines for Car Parking and Internal Traffic Circulation 2014), NOT by UBBL Part IX. UBBL Part IX (By-Laws 254-258) covers miscellaneous provisions. Each local authority sets its own parking standards.

## Parking Ratios (Typical Local Authority Requirements)

Minimum car parking provision (varies by local authority):

| Building Use | Parking Ratio |
|-------------|--------------|
| Residential (landed) | 2 lots per unit |
| Residential (apartment/flat) | 1.5 lots per unit |
| Office | 1 lot per **46 sq metres** gross floor area |
| Shop/retail | 1 lot per **46 sq metres** gross floor area |
| Hotel | 1 lot per **4 guest rooms** |
| Industrial/factory | 1 lot per **93 sq metres** gross floor area |
| Hospital | 1 lot per **4 beds** |
| School | 1 lot per **2 classrooms** |
| Place of worship | 1 lot per **10 seats** |

- Motorcycle parking: **20%** of car parking requirement
- Bicycle parking: **5%** of car parking requirement
- Visitor parking: typically **10%** of total parking requirement
