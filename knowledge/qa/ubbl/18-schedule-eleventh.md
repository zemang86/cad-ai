# Eleventh Schedule — Staircase Landing Width or Depth

Referenced by By-law 224A(8)(b).

## Staircase Landing Dimensions

| Staircase Width A (m) | Min Landing Width B (m) | Min Landing Depth C (m) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1.2** | **2.8** | **1.9** | Bed/stretcher evacuation; no pedestrian passing |
| **1.2** | **2.8** | **1.9** | Bed/stretcher evacuation; restricts ambulant passing |
| **1.5** | **3.2** | **1.55** | Bed/stretcher evacuation or ambulant passing |
| **1.75** | **3.6** | **1.35*** | Bed/stretcher evacuation or ambulant passing |
| **2.0** | **4.0** | **1.25*** | Bed/stretcher evacuation or ambulant passing |

**\*** Clear landing depth (instead of clear stairs width) shall be taken for calculating exit capacity of staircase.

### Key Design Principles

- Landing dimensions must accommodate **bed evacuation** and **stretcher evacuation** in hospitals and institutional buildings
- Wider staircases (1.5m+) allow simultaneous **ambulant passing** during evacuation
- For staircases of **1.2m width**: larger landing depth (**1.9m**) compensates for restricted passing space
- The Eleventh Schedule is specifically referenced for hospital buildings under **By-law 224A** (2021 Amendment)
