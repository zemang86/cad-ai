# Part V — Structural Requirements

## General Requirements (By-Laws 53-70)

- All buildings must be designed and constructed to safely sustain all dead loads, imposed loads, and wind loads
- Structural design must comply with relevant Malaysian Standards or British Standards where no MS equivalent exists
- Structural plans and calculations must be prepared and signed by a Professional Engineer
- The submitting engineer must specify and supervise subsurface investigation for structural design

### 2021 Amendment — PM PE 1991 Series Migration

The 2021 Amendment migrated structural design standards from British Standards to the **PM PE 1991 (Eurocode 1)** series:

- **By-Laws 54–69**: All references to BS load codes replaced with **PM PE 1991** (Malaysian National Annex to Eurocode 1: Actions on Structures)
- **PM PE 1991-1-1**: General actions — densities, self-weight, imposed loads
- **PM PE 1991-1-2**: Actions on structures exposed to fire
- **PM PE 1991-1-3**: Snow loads (limited applicability in Malaysia)
- **PM PE 1991-1-4**: Wind actions
- **PM PE 1991-1-7**: Accidental actions (impact, explosions)

## Foundation Requirements

- Foundation design must be based on adequate site investigation
- Soil investigation reports must be submitted with structural plans
- Foundations must be designed to distribute loads safely without excessive settlement
- Piling works require separate approval and supervision

### By-Law 73(1a): Geotechnical Testing — 2021 Amendment (NEW)

- **Field tests and laboratory tests** must be carried out for all geotechnical investigations
- Test results must be included in the structural submission to the local authority
- Applies to all buildings requiring foundation design beyond simple strip footings

> **Citation**: UBBL (Amendment 2021), By-Law 73(1a)

## By-Law 71: Vehicle Barriers — 2021 Amendment

- Multi-storey car parks shall be provided with vehicle barriers at all edges where vehicles could fall
- Barriers must be designed to withstand impact per **PM PE 1991-1-1** (2021 Amendment — previously referenced BS/MS)
- Impact force for cars: **150 kN** applied at **375mm** above floor level
- For heavy vehicles: impact force of **500 kN** at **610mm** above floor level
- Barriers required at all open edges of parking floors, ramps, and access routes

> **Citation**: Uniform Building By-Laws 1984, Part V, By-Law 71; Amendment 2021

## By-Law 76a: Buildings on Hillside — 2021 Amendment (NEW)

- Buildings on hillside sites (slope exceeding **15 degrees**) require additional structural submissions:
  - Slope stability analysis by a Professional Engineer (Geotechnical)
  - Drainage and erosion control measures
  - Retaining wall design where applicable
- Cut and fill operations must be supervised by a qualified geotechnical engineer

> **Citation**: UBBL (Amendment 2021), By-Law 76a

## Deleted By-Laws (2021 Amendment)

The following structural by-laws were **deleted** in the 2021 Amendment as they were superseded by PM PE 1991 series provisions:
- **By-Law 74**: Previously covered specific load combinations (now in PM PE 1991-1-1)
- **By-Law 76**: Previously covered specific foundation requirements (replaced by By-Law 76a for hillside and By-Law 73(1a) for geotechnical testing)
- **By-Law 77**: Previously covered specific structural calculations (now governed by PM PE 1991 series)

> **Citation**: UBBL (Amendment 2021)

## Load Requirements

| Load Type | Typical Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Residential floor load | **1.5 kN/sq m** |
| Office floor load | **2.5 kN/sq m** |
| Retail/shop floor load | **4.0 kN/sq m** |
| Car park floor load | **2.5 kN/sq m** |
| Plant room/mechanical | **7.5 kN/sq m** |

- Wind load calculations per **PM PE 1991-1-4** (2021 Amendment — previously MS 1553 or BS 6399)
- Seismic design not traditionally required but increasingly recommended following regional seismic activity

> **Citation**: Uniform Building By-Laws 1984, Part V; PM PE 1991 series

## Structural Integrity

- Buildings must be designed to avoid progressive collapse
- Adequate ties must be provided between structural elements
- Structural adequacy of existing buildings must be verified before alteration or extension
- Temporary works (shoring, propping) during construction must be designed by a competent engineer
