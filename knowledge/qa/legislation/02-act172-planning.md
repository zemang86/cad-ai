# Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172)

Applies to **Peninsular Malaysia** only. Sabah, Sarawak, and Federal Territory of KL use their own planning by-laws.

## Key Provisions

| Section | Subject | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| s.19 | Planning permission required | No development may commence without planning permission |
| s.21 | Application to LPA | Specified forms, plans, and fees |
| s.21A-21B | Development Proposal Report (DPR) | Must include: site description, topography, drainage, vegetation survey, land ownership, layout plans, social impact analysis |
| s.22(2) | Solid waste considerations | Amended 2007 to consider Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007 |
| s.31A | Conflict resolution | Where plans conflict with building by-laws, the **development plan prevails** |

> **Citation**: Town and Country Planning Act 1976, Sections 19-31A

## Planning Hierarchy

1. **National Physical Planning Council (NPPC/MPFN)** -- top-level direction
2. **Director General of Town & Country Planning (PLANMalaysia)** -- prepares National Physical Plan
3. **State Planning Committee** -- state-level policy
4. **Local Planning Authorities (LPAs)** -- decide planning applications

> **Citation**: Town and Country Planning Act 1976

## Plot Ratio, Setbacks, and Density

Act 172 does **NOT** prescribe specific numerical values for:
- Plot ratio
- Setbacks
- Building density
- Buffer zones

These are determined locally by each **Local Planning Authority (LPA)** through:
- Local Plans
- State Planning Guidelines (e.g., Selangor State Planning Manuals)
- Structure Plans

A concept masterplan submitted for planning permission must include a land use schedule covering setbacks, buffers, and open space.
