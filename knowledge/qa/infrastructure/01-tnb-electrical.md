# TNB (Tenaga Nasional Berhad) Electrical Supply

## Distribution Voltages

- **33kV**, **11kV**, and **400/230V** at **50Hz**
- Domestic supply: single phase 2-wire or three phase 4-wire
- Loads up to 100A (~70 kVA): tap from low-voltage network
- Loads above 350 kVA (~500A): typically require a new on-site substation

## Compact Substation Unit (CSU)

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| Standard land size | **5 metres x 7 metres** |
| Max capacity (residential) | **500 kVA** |
| Max capacity (commercial/industrial) | **1,000 kVA** |

- Must be placed close to load centre, not at corners of development
- Away from sewerage plants
- Developer identifies CSU location, obtains PBT/Land Office approval, submits Soil Investigation Report certified by Competent Engineer

## Service Cable

- Within **30 metres**: laid and maintained by TNB
- Beyond 30 metres: cost borne by the consumer

## Application Timeline

- Typical: **6 months to over 1 year** from application to power-on
- Large-scale developments may need land allocation for PMU (Main Intake Substation), wayleaves, or right of way for 132kV/275kV lines
