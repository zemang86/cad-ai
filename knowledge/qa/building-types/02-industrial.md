# Industrial Buildings (Factory/Warehouse)

## Triple Approval Required

Industrial buildings require approval from three external authorities **before** local authority licensing:
1. **DOSH** (Department of Occupational Safety and Health)
2. **DOE** (Department of Environment)
3. **BOMBA** (Fire & Rescue Department)

> **Citation**: Various regulatory requirements

## DOSH Requirements (OSHA 1994)

- Workplace risk assessments and safety documentation
- OSH Coordinator required for businesses with **5+ employees** (OSH Amendment Act 2022)
- Machinery requires: Design Approval, Permission to Install (PTI), Permission to Operate (PTO), Certificate of Fitness (CF)
