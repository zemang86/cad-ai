# High-Rise Building Fire Safety

## Definition

- **High-rise building**: Building exceeding **30 metres** in height (UBBL definition)
- Buildings over 30 metres: ALL floors must be compartment floors
- Floors more than **9 metres** above ground floor level have specific fire requirements

> **Citation**: Uniform Building By-Laws 1984, Part VII

## Refuge Floors

- Designated levels providing temporary shelter during fire emergency
- Equipped with essential fire safety facilities
- Functions: safe haven for fatigued evacuees and disabled persons, command points for firefighters, reduces stack effect in tall buildings
- International benchmark: every **20-30 floors** (varies by jurisdiction)
- Must be unoccupied and accessible from all staircases

> **Citation**: MS 1183:2015 Annex G; BOMBA guidelines

## Fire Lifts (By-Law 153)

- Required for buildings exceeding **4 storeys** or **18 metres** in height
- Fire lift must be within a **protected shaft**
- Fire lift lobby: fire resistance not less than **2 hours**
- Minimum car size: **1.1m x 2.1m**
- Fire mode of operation: firefighters can override normal operation
- Emergency mode during mains power failure
- Lift shaft ventilation and smoke detectors for lobbies required

> **Citation**: Uniform Building By-Laws 1984, Part VII, By-Law 153; By-Law 124

## Pressurized Staircases (By-Laws 198-202)

- Buildings over **18 metres**: mechanical ventilation required for staircase enclosures
- Pressurized staircase system maintains positive air pressure to prevent smoke entry
- Staircase enclosures for buildings below 18 metres may use natural ventilation
- Below-ground staircases require separate ventilation provisions

> **Citation**: Uniform Building By-Laws 1984, Part VII, By-Laws 198-202

## Fire Command Centre

- Large high-rise buildings should provide a fire command centre at ground floor level
- Houses main fire alarm control panel, communications equipment, building systems controls
- Must be accessible by fire brigade upon arrival
- BOMBA may require pre-consultation for buildings exceeding 30 metres

> **Citation**: BOMBA guidelines; MS 1183:2015

## BOMBA Pre-Consultation

- Pre-consultation with BOMBA advisable for:
  - Buildings exceeding **30 metres** height
  - Buildings with unusual fire engineering requirements
  - Performance-Based Approach (PBA) designs
- Fire Engineering Performance Based Approach Report may be required as alternative to prescriptive compliance
- Active fire protection submissions must include schematic drawings for sprinkler, hydrant, hose reel, intercom, and alarm systems
