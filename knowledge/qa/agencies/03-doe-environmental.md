# DOE (Department of Environment) Requirements

## EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment)

EIA required under Section 34A of the Environmental Quality Act 1974.

### Prescribed Activities Requiring EIA

| Activity | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| Housing development | >= **50 hectares** |
| Industrial estates | >= **20 hectares** |
| Coastal building/facilities | **80 rooms** or more in coastal area |
| Coastal reclamation | >= **50 hectares** |
| New aerodrome | Runway >= **1,000 metres** |

- **Preliminary EIA**: First Schedule activities, reviewed by DOE State Office
- **Detailed EIA**: Second Schedule activities, reviewed by DOE HQ, public display required
- EIA consultants must be registered with DOE

> **Citation**: Environmental Quality Act 1974, Section 34A; EIA Order 2015

## Effluent Discharge Standards (Fifth Schedule)

**Standard A**: discharge upstream of water supply intake
**Standard B**: discharge downstream (any other inland waters)

| Parameter | Standard A (mg/L) | Standard B (mg/L) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **BOD** (5-day, 20 deg C) | **20** | **50** |
| **COD** | **80** | **200** |
| **Suspended Solids** | **50** | **100** |
| Mercury | 0.005 | 0.05 |
| Lead | 0.10 | 0.50 |
| pH | 6.0-9.0 | 5.5-9.0 |
| Temperature | 40 deg C | 40 deg C |

## Noise Limits

Planning Guidelines for Environmental Noise Limits and Control (DOE, 3rd Edition 2019):

| Zone | Day (7am-10pm) | Night (10pm-7am) |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Industrial | **70 dBA** | **60 dBA** |

- Preferred index: **LAeq,T** (Equivalent A-weighted Sound Level)
- Construction sites: noise maps and noise modelling required

## Air Quality

- DOE Written Notification required for Air Emission Sources under Regulation 5
- Stack emission monitoring required for all types of stacks
- Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulations 2014 governs air quality standards

> **Citation**: Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulations 2014

## Penalties

- Fine up to **RM100,000** or imprisonment up to **5 years**, or both
- Continued offence after notice: **RM1,000/day**
- Section 19: Prescribed premises require DOE approval before construction
