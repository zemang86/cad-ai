# Malaysian Standards for Fire Safety

## MS 1910:2017 -- Automatic Sprinkler Systems

- Governs design and installation of automatic sprinkler systems
- Used alongside **NFPA 13** for Performance-Based Approach (PBA)
- Includes ESFR (Early Suppression Fast Response) sprinklers for atriums and large void areas
- With sprinklers: UBBL allows compartment size limits to be **doubled (x2)**

> **Citation**: MS 1910:2017

| Part | Content |
|------|---------|
| Part 1 | Construction and test methodology |
| Part 2 | Wheeled fire extinguishers |
| Part 3 | Selection and installation -- Code of practice |
| Part 4 | Inspection and maintenance -- Code of practice |
| Part 5 | Portable fire extinguisher for cooking oil fires (Class F) |
| Part 6 | Small, disposable and non-refillable fire extinguisher |

## MS 1183 -- Fire Safety Design

- **MS 1183:2015**: Code of Practice for Fire Safety Design of Buildings
- Referenced by UBBL for fire safety design approaches
- Annex G provides recommendations for refuges and evacuation lifts in high-rise buildings
- Basis for Performance-Based Approach (PBA) fire engineering

> **Citation**: MS 1183:2015

## MS ISO 14520 -- Gaseous Fire Extinguishing Systems

- Covers clean agent systems: HFC 125, HFC 227ea, HFC 23, IG-01, IG-55
- Physical properties and system design specifications
- Used for server rooms, archives, and other spaces where water-based systems are unsuitable
