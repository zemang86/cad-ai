# MS 1525:2019 -- Energy Efficiency (Non-Residential)

## Overview

MS 1525:2019 is the Code of Practice on Energy Efficiency and Use of Renewable Energy for Non-Residential Buildings (3rd revision, replacing MS 1525:2007).

## Key Requirements

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| **OTTV** (Overall Thermal Transfer Value) | <= **50 W/m2** |
| **RTTV** (Roof Thermal Transfer Value) | <= **25 W/m2** |
| Roof U-value (light roof, <50 kg/m2) | **0.4 W/m2K** |
| Roof U-value (heavy roof, >50 kg/m2) | **0.6 W/m2K** |
| **BEI** (Building Energy Intensity) benchmark | **136 kWh/sqm/year** (offices) |

> **Citation**: MS 1525:2019; UBBL By-Law 38a (Amendment 2021)

## Mandatory Application

- **UBBL By-Law 38a** (Amendment 2021): Non-residential buildings with AC space exceeding **4,000 sq metres** must comply with MS 1525
- Must provide an **Energy Management System (EMS)**
- MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standards): minimum performance set at **2-star** category level

> **Citation**: UBBL By-Law 38a (Amendment 2021)

## Coverage Areas

- Efficient lighting system design
- Minimising electrical power distribution losses
- Efficient ACMV (air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation) system design
- Energy management system design

## Passive Design Strategies

- Building orientation to minimise solar heat gain
- Adequate shading devices (horizontal/vertical)
- Appropriate insulation for walls and roof
- Natural ventilation where possible
- Daylighting to reduce artificial lighting needs
- Facade design with optimised window-to-wall ratio
